## Github Use Cases that I used and how did it help my submission?
1. I used Github Copilot's suggestions to write the code faster and efficiently.
2. The `CHANGABLE_KEY_ITEMS` in `constants.py` file are entirely based on the suggestions from Github Copilot
3. The User can change the items in the list and the script will work as expected.
4. I used Github Copilot to 
   - Write the `README.md` file as well.
   - Optimize the code and make it more efficient.
   - Color the output text in the terminal.
   - To generate Documentation for the each function in the code
   - To Make it more readable
   - To make it more pythonic
